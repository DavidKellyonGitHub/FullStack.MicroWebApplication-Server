'A global realignment: Some countries see outbreaks explode as others look to restart economies.
The fluid nature of the coronavirus is forcing a global realignment, as countries that were once at the heart of the crisis pass their peaks and new areas emerge as points of concern.
Turkey, which for weeks had maintained it was ahead of other nations in stemming the spread of the coronavirus, surpassed China on Sunday, with more than 86,000 confirmed cases and  2,017 deaths.
The government has attributed the high number of cases to widespread testing, but health experts warn that the rate of infection could increase if restrictions on movement are delayed.
The confirmed coronavirus toll in Europe passed one million infections and 100,000 deaths, according to the latest figures from the European Center for Disease Control, but many nations are cautiously making attempts to restart public life.',

'Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday the United States and Canada have agreed to keep their border closed to nonessential travel for another 30 days, and he said it undoubtedly will be longer before the restriction is removed.
President Donald Trump, in a roller-coaster week of reversals and contradictions, told governors to “call your own shots” on lifting stay-at-home orders once the coronavirus threat subsides. But then he took to Twitter to push some to reopen their economies quickly and tell them it was their job to ramp up testing.
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee fired back, taking to national television to say Trump was encouraging people “to violate the law” and risk spreading coronavirus. A few hours later, more than 2,000 demonstrators assembled at the Capitol in Olympia, toting American flags as they urged Inslee to lift the stay-at-home order. They brought children and firearms, and few practiced social distancing — in violation of Inslee’s order.
Six weeks after long-term care facilities first emerged as a deadly front of the coronavirus pandemic, Washington state says it’s now aiming for widespread testing in those facilities. The state’s goal is to get enough supplies to allow for universal masking of staff and to test all residents and employees in facilities with COVID-19 cases.
The most recent count of COVID-19 cases in Washington totals 11,790 infections and 634 deaths, according to the state Department of Health.
Throughout Sunday, on this page, we’ll be posting updates from Seattle Times journalists and others on the pandemic and its effects on the Seattle area, the Pacific Northwest and the world. Updates from Saturday can be found here, and all our coronavirus coverage can be found here.

'As the world scrambles to find a cure to coronavirus, there is one self-administered treatment that is undoubtedly not going to provide the solution: 40% proof alcohol.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that excess alcohol consumption may weaken the body’s immune system and render people vulnerable to contracting Covid-19. So it was surprising that John Daly, the professional golfer from California, should have posted a video earlier this month suggesting vodka could combat the virus.
It was doubly surprising that Donald Trump’s golf company, Trump Golf, should then have retweeted the video on its official Twitter feed.
Daly’s comments – ill-judged joke or ignorant conviction, it’s hard to say – were posted to YouTube. The two-time major championship-winner begins the video by praising Trump Golf courses, then extends his hope that everyone listening remains safe from Covid-19.
That’s when his remarks, first reported by Golfweek, take a contentions turn. “I kinda got a cure for this,” he says, grabbing a frosted bottle of the Polish vodka, Belvedere.',

'New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday he faced sharp questions - from his own adult daughters - on why he had not looked overseas to buy coronavirus test kits.
Cuomo said his family was watching TV news on Monday night when a story aired on Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who with help from his wife, just scored 500 test kits from her native South Korea,
"My daughter turns to me and looks at me and says, ''Wow that was really smart,'' " said Cuomo, father of three adult daughters. "One of my other daughters, who''s a little more pointed in life ... said, ''Why didn''t you think of that, Dad? Why didn''t you think of buying test kits from South Korea?''"
The New York governor was hammering home his belief that the federal government should take the lead in securing equipment to contain the pandemic, though he heaped praise on his Maryland counterpart: "God bless Larry Hogan; he really thought outside the box." ',
